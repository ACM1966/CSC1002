Number Guessing Game - two players A & B

Hereâ€™s how it works:

One player (A) picks a secret number and let the other player (B) to guess.  

Player B has 20 attempts to guess.  The game ends when either a correct guess is made 
or the number of attempts reaches 20.

The secret number is a 4-digit number, with no repeated digits, leading zero is fine.  

For examples: 1345, 0913 and 3491 are valid numbers, while 0232 is not.

As each guess is made, player B will receive two additional pieces of information: 
    correct count and misplaced count.

Correct count is the number of digits that appear both in the guess and in the secret number 
AND in the same location.

Misplaced count is the number of digits that appear both in the guess and in the secret number 
BUT in different locations.

Examples: secret-number=1357, guess=9371

correct count=1 (digit 3), misplaced count=2 (digits 1 and 7)
